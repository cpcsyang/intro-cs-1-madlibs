    Introduction to Computer Science class -  Assignmnet 1 Madlibs
    (Python)

## After each step, Make sure you: 
- Commit code
- Push your code to GitHub.com

## Step 1. Create and print a story with the following minimums tasks:
- 5 lines of text (about 1 sentence per line)
- at least 1 name (e.g. Bob, Spike, Zoe)
- at least 2 animals (e.g. dog, cat, iguana)
- at least 3 adjectives (e.g. red, big, delicious)
- at least 3 verbs (e.g. eat, play, jump)
- at least 4 nouns (e.g. house, chocolate, banana)
- at least 3 numbers (e.g. 43, 17, -4)

## Step 2. 
- create variables and assign associated text
- replace the associated text in your story with variables
- use number to differenciate different nouns (e.g. noun_1, noun_2)
- For example, if step 1 code is:
```
    print("Hello Frank! How are you?")
```
- Then step 2 code is:
```
    name = "Frank"
    print("Hello " + name + "! How are you?")
```

## Step 3.
- add player instructions at the beginning
- instead of assign a fixed value, now ask the user for these values
- remember how to ask the user for an ***input***?
- remember how to ***cast*** the value to the right data type
